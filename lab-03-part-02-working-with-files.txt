2. Find out if mtec-1003-lab-03 already exists (from the previous lab).  If it doesn't, go back to the previous lab and find the steps regarding downloading the lab materials.

(See steps 1-8 in https://citytech.s3.amazonaws.com/mtec-1003-lab-03.tar.gz

3. Change your directory mtec1002-lab-03
[NO OUTPUT]

4. Create a directory called my_files
[NO OUTPUT]
----------
==========
5. Change the directory to my_files
[NO OUTPUT]
----------
==========
6. Create a new file using touch.

$ touch foo.txt
$ ls
Copy and paste the output below.
----------

foo.txt

==========
7. Create another new file using touch.

$ touch bar.txt
----------

bar.txt foo.txt

==========
8. List the files in this directory using the flag that gives the most details.

Copy and paste the output below.
----------
$ls

James@DESKTOP-07L4K8I MINGW64 ~/mtec1003-lab-03/my_files
$ ls
bar.txt  foo.txt

James@DESKTOP-07L4K8I MINGW64 ~/mtec1003-lab-03/my_files


or


$ wc my_files
wc: my_files: Is a directory
      0       0       0 my_files




==========
9. Create a copy of bar.txt called baz.txt and then list the files again.


Write the command that you used to copy the file.  Additionally, copy and paste the output of your file listing below.
----------

$cp bar.txt baz.txt
$ls
bar.txt  baz.txt  foo.txt

==========
10. Delete the file called bar.txt and then list the files again.

Write the command that you used to remove the file.  Copy and paste the output of your file listing below.
----------

$rm bar.txt
$ls

James@DESKTOP-07L4K8I MINGW64 ~/mtec1003-lab-03/my_files
$ rm bar.txt

James@DESKTOP-07L4K8I MINGW64 ~/mtec1003-lab-03/my_files
$ ls
baz.txt  foo.txt


==========
11. Move the file called foo.txt to qux.txt and then list the files again.


Write the command that you used to move the file.  Copy and paste the output of your file listing below.
----------
$mv foo.txt quz.txt
$ls

James@DESKTOP-07L4K8I MINGW64 ~/mtec1003-lab-03/my_files
$ mv foo.txt quz.txt

James@DESKTOP-07L4K8I MINGW64 ~/mtec1003-lab-03/my_files
$ ls
baz.txt  quz.txt



==========
12. Go up one directory so that you're in ~/mtec-1003-lab-03
[NO OUTPUT]
----------



==========
13. Try removing the directory called my_files using rmdir.

Write out the command that you used and what happened.
----------
$rmdir my_files

rmdir: failed to remove 'my_files': Directory not empty

I think what happened is that $rmdir can't remove a directory that has files inside of it. It can only remove a directory if there are no files inside of it.



==========
14. Try removing the directory called my_files using rm.

Write out the command that you used and what happened.
----------
$rm my_files

rm: cannot remove 'my_files': Is a directory

I think what happened is that $rm can remove files inside a directory and not a directory itself so it can't remove the my_files directory.



==========
15. MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN THE mtec1002-lab-03 directory!  

Force the removal of the directory and files using the -rf flag

$ rm -rf my_files
----------
$ rm -rf my_files
----------
It got rid of the directory.



==========
16. There's a txt file version of a book located in the mtec1002-lab-03 folder.  It is in the following directory if you're in the lab folder:

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command called cat on the file to show its contents. 

Describe what happened below.
----------
$cat pg1232.txt

It looks like it printed out everything that was on that page, word for word.


==========
17. That was a lot of text.  Let's find ways to limit it.  Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command, head, on the file to show the contents of the beginning of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below (it should be the title).
----------
$head pg[TAB][ENTER]

Title: The Prince


==========
18. Using the same file again!

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use tail on the file to show the contents of the end of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below (it should be the title).
----------
$tail [TAB][ENTER]


This was the last output for the file using $tail.

==========
19. Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use less and more on the file to show the contents of the file.  Try pressing spacebar and/or q afterwards.

Write the command that you used below.  Describe what spacebar and q does after using either less or more.
----------
$less [TAB][ENTER]

Pressing spacebar loaded more of the text and pressing q made it erase/disappear and went to the start of a new command line.

For some reason, doing more gave an error.

bash: more: command not found

==========
20. Describe what situations you would use the following commands for viewing files: less, more, cat, tail, head

(Some characteristics that may help your description might be the length of the file, whether or not you'd like to read the whole thing... or just the beginning or end, etc.)
----------
Less if you wanted to read one part of something first so that's a little bit of info at a time.
More if you want to read everything at once I think.
Cat if you want to know everything right away.
Tail if you want to read it from last to first.
Head if you want to read it from first to last.


==========
21.  How many words are in pg1232.txt?  What command did you use to determine the word count?
----------
$wc [TAB][ENTER]

5063  52639 305864 pg1232.txt

Words is the second one so there are 52,639 words in the txt.


==========
22.  How many lines are in pg1232.txt?  What command did you use to determine the line count?
----------
$wc [TAB][ENTER]

5063  52639 305864 pg1232.txt

Lines is the first one so there are 5,063 lines in the txt.
