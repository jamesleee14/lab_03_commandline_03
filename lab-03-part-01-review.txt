3. Are there any directories or files in your directory that have the word mtec1002 in it?

Write the command(s) that you used to determine this - as well as its output - below:
----------
I don't have any.
I believe the command is cat so I did $cat mtec1002 but there is nothing.

Output:
cat: mtec1002: No such file or directory

==========
4. If there are directories or files in your home directory that have the word mtec1002 in them, list them below (otherwise skip this step):
----------



==========
5. Delete these directories from your home folder by using this command:

$ rm -rf [name of directory/folder]

for example:

$ rm -rf mtec1002-labs-02

(skip if these directories don't exist)
----------



==========
6.  A compressed archive (.tar.gz) of the lab files can be found at this url: 

http://foureyes.github.io/mtec1002-spring2014/labs/03/mtec1002-lab-03.tar.gz

Download this file to your home directory into a file called mtec1002-lab-03.tar.gz.   Use a command that we learned to do this.

This command should have a *flag* to specify the output file.  MAKE SURE TO NAME YOUR OUTPUT FILE: mtec1002-lab-03.tar.gz

Write the command(s) that you used to download this file - as well as its output - below:
----------
$curl -o mtec1003-lab-03.tar.gz. http://foureyes.github.io/mtec1002-spring2014/labs/03/mtec1002-lab-03.tar.gz

==========
7.  Uncompress the file that you just downloaded.

Write the command(s) that you used to do this - as well as its output - below:
----------
$tar -xvf mtec1003-lab-03.tar.gz 

I thought that this was to uncompress a tar.gz file but it gives me a different output.

Output:
tar: This does not look like a tar archive

gzip: stdin: not in gzip format
tar: Child returned status 1
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now

I also tried doing $tar -xvf mtec1003-lab-03.tar.gz.tar.gz, but it gives me this:
tar: mtec1003-lab-03.tar.gz.tar.gz: Cannot open: No such file or directory
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now


==========
8.  You should now have a directory called mtec1002-lab-03 in your home directory.  Verify that this directory exists.

If the directory does not exist:

a. go to your home folder
b. go back to step 6

Otherwise...

Write the command(s) that you used to do this - as well as its output - below:
----------
I did $cd ~. Then, I did $mkdir mtec1003-lab-03. Then, I did $ls to make sure it was there.

Output:

==========
9.  What directories are in the mtec1002-lab-03 folder?

Write the command(s) that you used to determine this - as well as its output - below:
----------
I did $ cd mtec1003-lab-03 and then did $ls. THere are no directories in here.

James@DESKTOP-07L4K8I MINGW64 ~/mtec1003-lab-03
$ ls

James@DESKTOP-07L4K8I MINGW64 ~/mtec1003-lab-03

==========
10.  Now... go back home.  Then change to the science-fiction directory using a relative path.  The directory is located in books... which is located in the mtec1002-lab-03 directory.  Verify you're in the right directory using pwd.

Write the command(s) (including going home) that you used to do this below:
----------
I can't do that since I don't have any of those.

Output:
/c/Users/James



==========
11.  Write the files that are in the science fiction directory below.

Write the command(s) that you used to do this - as well as its output - below:
----------
Same as above.


==========
12.  Again, go back to your home directory.  Now... go to the science-fiction directory using an absolute path!  Verify that you're in the right directory using pwd.

Write the command(s) that you used to do this below:
----------
Same as above. I think the reason I can't do the last 3 questions(this question and the 2 before this) is because I don't have that file. I did it the way I was supposed to but it didn't work.


==========
OPTIONAL
13. Immediately change back to the mtec1002-lab-03 folder with a single command using a *relative* path.

Write the command(s) that you used to do this below:
----------

==========
OPTIONAL
14. Find out what the most recently modified directory is in mtec1002 (there are only 3 to choose from)?  How would you find this out?  Hint: perhaps using something to show the modified date... and sort it by time.

Write the command(s) that you used to do this below:
----------

==========
OPTIONAL
15. Create a compressed archive of the logs folder - that is... take the contents of logs and create a single archive (.tar), and compress (.gz)

Write the command(s) that you used to do this below:
----------
